# Streetwear online store project

https://streetwear-store.vercel.app/

This is a project I started to learn how to intergrate MongoDB into an app. It's basically just a simple online clothing store that sells shirts, sneakers, and hats. It's what Supreme's [website](https://www.supremenewyork.com/shop/all) wishes it could be if it wasn't so damn ugly.

I used a single database and queryed the results based on which page you're on(/shirts, /sneakers, and /hats).
